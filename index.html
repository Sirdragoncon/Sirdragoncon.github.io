   <span> 75MPH.</span> To hunt their prey they stalk it first then run until either the prey or the Cheetah give up. </p>
       <p>Cheetah cubs can sometimes be attacked or eaten by hyenas which happen to be one of their biggest predators! </p>
       <p>Cheetahs are spotted to camoflauge themselves and hide from other predators.</p>
